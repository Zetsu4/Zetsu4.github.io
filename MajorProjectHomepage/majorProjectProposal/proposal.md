# AMAZING COOL SUPERB Proposal

I would like to make a game that is a top-down, RPG.
It will play similarly to an MMO, but single player so MSO (Massively Single-player Offline).

## Need to Have List
  - movement
  - player attacks/deaths
  - enemy deaths
  - mini-map
  - settings screen
  - boundaries
  - different attack types
  - start screen
  - inventory

## Nice to Have List
  - player and enemy stats
  - new areas (caves, and what not)
  - NPC's
  - sound effects
  - rebinding keys
  - enemy AI
  - enemy attack
  - equipment
  - equipping items
  - pretty pictures
  - interacting with inventory
  - items
  - title for game
